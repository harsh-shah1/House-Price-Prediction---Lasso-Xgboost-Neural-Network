# House-Price-Prediction---Lasso-Xgboost-Neural-Network
# Problem Statement
This project aims at predicting residential house prices in Ames,Iowa based on 80 attributes. 
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle's Housing Data set knowledge competition. 
# Data Exploration 
I have used matplotlib and seaborn extensively for the Data exploration and Scikit learn for Data preprocessing and Feature engineering.

# Dependencies
● matplotlib ● seaborn ● keras ● numpy ● pandas ● scikit-learn 

# Modeling
I have installed Xgboost while lasso is imported from the scikit learn package. 
For Neural Network model, I used 'adam' as the optimizer and 'mean_squared_error' as the loss function.
